## Background

CityFix is a solution to help city residents **improve their neighbourhood**. If residents witness something that needs fixing, such as a cracked pavement or a stained wall, they can post an issue request on CityFix. Public Works Officers will then receive the requests and get to work as soon as they can. Residents can view the completion status of their requests when logged into their account.

**For public works officers:** CityFix helps public works administrators focus on actually doing their work, rather than merely managing their work. Administrators will receive an overview of the public works requests from all resident users. They can then plan their schedule accordingly to optimize their effectiveness.

But really - for the purposes of learning, this is a simple web app built using Node.js/Express, with the following features:
* Multiple models: Issue requests, and Users
* Full CRUD functionality for Issue requests
* Different capabilities and access levels for Residents vs. Admins
* Passport login and authentication
* Dedicated Issue pages and User profile pages
